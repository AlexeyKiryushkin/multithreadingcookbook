Code samples for Multithreading in C# 5.0 Cookbook
======================

Here are the code samples from my book Multithreading in C# 5.0 Cookbook, converted to Visual Studio 2013 and Windows 8.1
You can use Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop to open most of the recipes, and Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows to open Windows Store samples from Chapter 11. Just open the corresponging .sln file.
